# Climate Change and Agriculture

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between climate change and agricultural variables, focusing on how increasing CO2 emissions over time correlate with crop yields, pesticide usage, and agricultural GDP. The analysis examines CO2 emissions on national and global scales to determine how these emissions interact with a country’s agricultural profile. Key variables include crop yield, crop type, pesticide use, and gross domestic product (GDP).

## Project Details

### Goals
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- To determine whether countries with higher agricultural land use have higher CO2 emissions.
- To explore the correlation between CO2 emissions and crop yield.
- To examine whether pesticide use has led to improved crop yields and reduced land use over time.
- To analyze whether countries with higher CO2 emissions utilize more pesticides in agricultural production.
- To identify the relationship between CO2 emissions and agricultural GDP.

### Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) and the Kaggle dataset [Climate Change Impact on Agriculture](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/climate-change-impact-on-agriculture/data).

2. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Relevant columns related to CO2 emissions and agricultural variables were selected for analysis. The cleaning process involved the removal of missing data, duplicates, and renaming columns for consistency. Merging datasets required standardizing country names for compatibility.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   Summary statistics were generated to analyze the central tendencies and variations in crop yields per hectare. Linear regressions and Pearson’s correlation tests were conducted to examine the relationships between CO2 emissions and other variables. Time series data were also visualized to track CO2 emissions over time by country.

4. **Feature Engineering:**  
   New variables were created, such as:
   - **ag_gdp**: Agricultural GDP relative to the country's total GDP.
   - **pop_to_gdp**: Population-to-GDP ratio.
   - **pop_to_ag_gdp**: Population-to-agricultural-GDP ratio.

5. **Database Setup and Management:**  
   A MongoDB database was used to manage and store the datasets, facilitating efficient querying and analysis of key variables such as CO2 emissions, GDP, and agricultural data.

6. **Data Analysis:**  
   Correlation analysis was performed on both individual and cumulative datasets. A multiple linear regression model was built to predict CO2 emissions based on population, GDP, and agricultural GDP. Additional linear regressions analyzed the relationship between CO2 emissions and crop yield both in the USA and globally for various crops.

7. **Visualization:**  
   Various visualizations were generated, including scatter plots, line charts, and heatmaps to explore relationships among CO2 emissions, agricultural variables, and GDP quartiles.

8. **Statistical Analysis:**  
   A statistical summary was compiled, and Pearson’s correlation tests were performed. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze trends and relationships between key variables.

9. **Tools and Libraries:**  
   - **Pandas**: Data cleaning and manipulation  
   - **Numpy**: Numerical computations  
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualizations  
   - **Sklearn**: Linear regression modeling  
   - **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations  
   - **Dash**: Dashboard development  
   - **Pymongo**: Database interactions
